# Readme
This repository belongs to the MSc. Thesis by Tom Driessen. It can be found in the [TU Delft repository](https://repository.tudelft.nl). 

The jupyter notebook files in this repository contain the output that was generated with the original participant data. These notebooks can be viewed directly in GitHub as the output of the code is stored within the notebooks. If this doesn't work, try reloading ([there is a bug under investigation by github](https://github.com/iurisegtovich/PyTherm-applied-thermodynamics/issues/11#issuecomment-323842311))  or the copy the url and view online on https://nbviewer.jupyter.org. Alternatively, the notebooks can be viewed by downloading them and viewing them on a local installation of jupyter. When choosing the last option, I recommend to install [anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/) which contains python (I used v3.7), jupyter as well as all the packages used for the analysis.

These notebooks are supplementary material. A reader in a hurry may be most satisfied with Analysis A, B and C.
