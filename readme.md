# Readme
This repository belongs to the MSc. Thesis by Tom Driessen. It can be found in the TU Delft repository at XXXreference. A data set that contains raw recordings can be found on data.4tu.nl XXXreference.

The jupyter notebook files in this repository contain the output that was generated with the original participant data. These notebooks can be viewed directly in GitHub as the output of the code is stored within the notebooks. Alternatively, the notebooks can be viewed online at https://nbviewer.jupyter.org, or by downloading the notebooks and viewing them on a local installation of jupyter. When choosing the last option, I recommend to install [anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/) which contains python (I used v3.7), jupyter as well as all the packages used for the analysis.

These notebooks are supplementary material. Please regard the notebook DataStructure.ipynb to get an overview of how our data was structured. The reader is also referred to our published dataset on data.4tu.nl XXX add reference.
